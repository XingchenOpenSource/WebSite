# TodayDiscourse
## Introduction
What you think today can be summed up in one sentence.  
Today's Word is a one-word API based on [CPython] (https://www.python.org/), which can get a daily sentence from the thesaurus when it is called.

## Deployment
First, you need to install Python 3.11+.
After installation, open the command line and run the following command:
```bash
pip install TodayDiscourse
TodayDiscourse [port]
```

## Call
Use a GET request or directly access the address of the API deployment website to get the word of the day.
